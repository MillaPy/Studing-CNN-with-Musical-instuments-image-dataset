# Studing-CNN-with-Musical-instuments-image-dataset
We have big dataset. Three big folders with different musical instruments. So, I decided to break the project tasks into several notebooks with done job. The first part about exploration the dataset and analysing the random images, on the other hand, second part is about working with custom model, likewise, the third one is working with keras pre-trained model. Then the last part is to give summary, in the end of whole project.
